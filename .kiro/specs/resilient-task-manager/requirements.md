# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Resilient Task Manager is a frontend application that demonstrates professional-grade architecture by completely decoupling the UI from its backend through a robust mock API layer. The application serves as a to-do manager with Persian language support, built to handle real-world challenges like network latency, API failures, and loading states gracefully. The core technical challenge is implementing Mock Service Worker (MSW) to simulate a production-like REST API environment, combined with React Query for sophisticated client-side server state management, all while maintaining a responsive and user-friendly experience with Material UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Management Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform CRUD operations on tasks, so that I can manage my to-do list effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the add task button AND enters task details THEN the system SHALL create a new task and display it in the task list
2. WHEN the user clicks the edit button on a task AND modifies the task details THEN the system SHALL update the task with the new information
3. WHEN the user clicks the toggle button on a task THEN the system SHALL change the task's completion status between completed and incomplete
4. WHEN the user clicks the delete button on a task THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the list
5. IF a task operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the relevant UI controls to prevent duplicate operations

### Requirement 2: Mock API Layer with MSW

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a realistic mock API using MSW, so that the application can be developed and tested without a real backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize MSW with REST API handlers for task operations
2. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL simulate network latency of at least 500ms
3. WHEN API handlers process requests THEN the system SHALL maintain task data in localStorage to persist across page refreshes
4. WHEN API handlers are invoked THEN the system SHALL randomly return error responses (500 or 404) with a configurable probability to simulate real-world failures
5. WHEN a GET /tasks request is made THEN the system SHALL return all tasks from the mock database
6. WHEN a POST /tasks request is made with valid task data THEN the system SHALL create a new task and return it with a generated ID
7. WHEN a PUT /tasks/:id request is made with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the specified task and return the updated task
8. WHEN a DELETE /tasks/:id request is made THEN the system SHALL remove the specified task and return a success response
9. IF an invalid task ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error response

### Requirement 3: Client-Side Server State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use React Query to manage all API interactions, so that the application has proper caching, loading states, and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use React Query to fetch tasks from the mock API
2. WHEN a task operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate and refetch the relevant queries to keep the UI in sync
3. WHEN the same data is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL serve it from cache when appropriate
4. WHEN the user navigates back to the task list THEN the system SHALL use cached data while revalidating in the background
5. IF an API request fails THEN the system SHALL expose the error state to the UI components
6. WHEN an API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL expose the loading state to the UI components
7. IF a mutation fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry functionality

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback when operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what's happening with my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly toast notification in Persian with the error message
2. WHEN a task is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification in Persian
3. WHEN a task is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification in Persian
4. WHEN a task is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification in Persian
5. IF a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a message like "عملیات ناموفق بود. لطفا دوباره تلاش کنید" (Operation failed. Please try again)
6. WHEN an error toast is displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically dismiss it after 5 seconds OR allow manual dismissal

### Requirement 5: Loading States and UI Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators during operations, so that I know the application is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial task list is loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loaders for task items
2. WHEN a task operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner on the relevant button
3. WHEN data is being fetched in the background THEN the system SHALL show a subtle loading indicator without blocking the UI
4. IF the task list is empty and not loading THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message in Persian
5. WHEN any loading state is active THEN the system SHALL ensure the UI remains responsive and doesn't appear frozen

### Requirement 6: TypeScript Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for all API interactions, so that I have compile-time safety and better developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining API responses THEN the system SHALL have a Task type with all required fields (id, title, description, completed, createdAt, updatedAt)
2. WHEN defining error responses THEN the system SHALL have an ApiError type with status code and message fields
3. WHEN using React Query hooks THEN the system SHALL have properly typed query and mutation hooks with generic type parameters
4. WHEN MSW handlers return data THEN the system SHALL ensure response types match the defined TypeScript interfaces
5. IF there is a type mismatch between API and UI THEN the system SHALL produce a TypeScript compilation error

### Requirement 7: Material UI Integration with Persian Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want a beautiful and intuitive interface in Persian, so that I can easily use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders THEN the system SHALL use Material UI components for all UI elements
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the Vazir font for Persian text rendering
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL configure Material UI theme with RTL (right-to-left) direction for Persian language
4. WHEN displaying task cards THEN the system SHALL use Material UI Card components with proper spacing and elevation
5. WHEN showing buttons THEN the system SHALL use Material UI Button components with appropriate variants and colors
6. WHEN displaying forms THEN the system SHALL use Material UI TextField components with Persian labels and placeholders
7. IF validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages in Persian using Material UI's error styling

### Requirement 8: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests using React Testing Library and MSW, so that I can ensure the application works correctly under various scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL use MSW to mock API responses in all tests
2. WHEN testing the happy path THEN the system SHALL verify that tasks are displayed correctly after successful API calls
3. WHEN testing loading states THEN the system SHALL verify that loading skeletons appear while React Query is fetching data
4. WHEN testing error states THEN the system SHALL override MSW handlers to return errors and verify error messages are displayed
5. WHEN testing task creation THEN the system SHALL verify the new task appears in the list after successful creation
6. WHEN testing task deletion THEN the system SHALL verify the task is removed from the list after successful deletion
7. WHEN testing task toggle THEN the system SHALL verify the task's completion status changes correctly
8. IF an API error is simulated in tests THEN the system SHALL verify that the appropriate error toast is displayed to the user

### Requirement 9: Code Organization and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase, so that it's easy to read, maintain, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct directories (components, hooks, services, types, mocks, tests)
2. WHEN creating React Query hooks THEN the system SHALL define them in a dedicated hooks directory with clear naming conventions
3. WHEN defining MSW handlers THEN the system SHALL organize them in a mocks directory separate from application code
4. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent structure with proper separation of logic and presentation
5. WHEN defining types THEN the system SHALL centralize them in a types directory for reusability
6. IF a component grows too large THEN the system SHALL be structured to allow easy extraction into smaller components
